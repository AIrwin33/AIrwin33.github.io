			<p>This was a very interesting prompt. I've been asking questions my entire life, and probably giving answers to questions in some for the same amount of time. Some of earlier questions and answers probably involved getting my basic needs met, and were fairly easy to figure out.</p>

			<p>As I delve into the world of software development, some of these questions become more complex. We were asked to research how to ask technical questions and reflect on that research.</p>

			<p>I looked through a few questions that were posted today that were either downvoted or didn't have answers to them. I noticed a few common themes that were also discussed on the sites that I found in my research.The questions were not clear or basically just said "This is happening, HELP!"</p>

			<p>From my past experience looking up answers to questions on stackoverflow, the questions(and answers) that got upvoted the most were those that hit all of the markers discussed in my research into asking a good question. Similar to coding in general, there is a certain amount of empathy involved in asking a question. What information does the person answering the question need or not need? How can you make the most use of their time and not bog them down in unnecessary details?</p>

			<p>The most interesting piece of advice I found during my research had to do with how and when to add your code into a question. To ask a question most effectively, you need to create a minimal, complete and verifiable example. 

			This may also help you break down the code to find the problem, relieving you of the task of submitting a question on stackoverflow at all.</p>
