			<p>So you've worked with objects and methods in Ruby and gotten familiar with them. What if we have a series of objects of the same type and want to define parameters based on a set of methods? Using <em>class</em>, Rubyists can organize objects by a class and then define methods that operate on that class.</p>
			<p>To see how this works, lets look at a class called Beer, which tells you how much a beer costs.</p>
			<p>
				<code>
class Beer
	def initialize(name, location)
		@name = name
		@location = location
	end
	def set_price(amount)
		@price = amount
		puts "That beer costs $#{@price}."
	end
	def price
		@price
	end
	def no_way
		if @price > 10
		puts "No way! thats way too expensive."
		else 
		puts "Alright I'll take it."
		end
	end
end

beer = Beer.new("Goose Island", "Chicago, IL")
beer.set_price(7)
beer.no_way


				</code>
			</p>
			<p>Instance variables allow you to remember the state that an object is in so that it can be called, printed out, etc. the variable can retain its value after the method that initialized the variable is terminated. You can create an instance variable using the "@". As you can see in the instance method no_way, the variable @price continues to pass even though it is outside the method that initiated it.</p>
			<p>Instance methods enable developers to call a method within a class that may have a specific function. Look over the method no_way and think about what it is doing. Now look down to the driver tests. you can see that we have established "beer" to equal a new beer that is initialized with a name and location. Below that we are calling the instance method no_way by typing "beer.no_way"</p>
			<p>This is only the beginning of what you can do with classes in Ruby, but I hope this gave you a good introduction.</p>
