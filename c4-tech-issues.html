			<p>High profile start-ups from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-leadership/wp/2014/05/30/snapchat-sexism-and-the-reason-women-dont-stay-in-tech/">Snapchat</a> to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/06/25/facebook-diversity/11369019/">Facebook</a> to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/23/twitters-diversity-report-is-more-of-the-same/">Twitter</a> have been in the news recently due to the revelation of less than stellar diversity metrics. News Flash: Silicon Valley is overwhelmingly white and male.</p>
			<p>The problem reaches beyond the Valley, to arguably every corner of the tech start-up industry, as <a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140724/TECHNOLOGY/140729926/report-citys-tech-gender-gap-is-nations-largest">this Crain's article</a> illustrates. First-hand accounts of women working in this industry point the finger at a culture that is non-inclusive and often times sexist.</p>
			<p>Issues typically raise their head in the hiring process and after developers are brought on board. In both situations, many women are turned off by pervasive "brogrammer" culture. Gendered language in job postings such as "dominant", "rockstar", "hacker", and "superior" turn off many women (and men) who are discouraged by such masculine, aggressive language. Once brought on to a team of developers, an environment that prioritizes cool perks, crushing the competition, and after-hours binge-drinking over a collaborative, supportive team environment can do similar damage.</p>
			<p>Etsy, the online craft marketplace, took the issue head on, creating an in-house developer bootcamp targeting women. Struggling to find a good pipeline of female developers, Etsy built their own pipeline. Etsy is open to attracting women to their company not only for their developer skills, but for what other skillsets and knowledge they can bring to the table.</p>
			<p>The model at Dev Bootcamp tries like Etsy to capture value beyond just learning how to code. This not only attracts people with different learning styles, but people who are open to learning the soft skills that are required by many companies and help foster a less aggressive environment. DBC has also established a scholarship fund to encourage women and other underrepresented groups to enroll in the program.</p>
			<p>Hiring managers can start by looking to examples of more balanced, inviting job postings. Ultimately it is up to all members of the developer community to create an inviting and collaborative atmosphere.</p>
