			<p>The group_by method takes an object and block and returns a hash that contains groups organized by whatever designation you assigned(size, length, alphabetical). This is a simple way of taking an array and passing it to a hash. The elements of the array are then passed to the values of the hash, while whatever organizational assignment was given passed to a key.</p>
			<p>The code should look something like this:</p>
			<p>
				<code>
	object.group_by {|object| block}
				</code>
			</p>
			<p>Lets say we wanted to sort an array of types of fruit by the length of the string.</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
			<p>
				<code>
		
	fruit = ["apples", "tomatoes", "grapefruit", "bananas", "papayas", "mangoes", "blackberries", "grapes"] <br/>
	Note on sorting: don't forget that the computer organizes uppercase and lowercase words differently. make sure your strings are lowercase or use the downcase method before sorting.<br/>
	p fruit.group_by {|fruit| fruit.length}<br/>
	The result groups each fruit by its string length.<br/>
	{6=>["apples", "grapes"], 8=>["tomatoes"], 10=>["grapefruit"], 7=>["bananas", "papayas", "mangoes"], 12=>["blackberries"]}
					
				</code>
			</p>
			<p>What other situations are appropriate to use the group_by enumerable method? Looking through what other people in the cohort did for Challenge #6, I noticed that almost everyone had code that was completely different. Did anyone look at using the group_by method to organize the cohort by various methods available for the block?</p>
