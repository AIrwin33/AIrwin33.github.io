		<div id="title">CSS Design: What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?<br/> Technical Blog<br/> Andrew Irwin<br/> November 6, 2014</div>
		<div id="body">Positioning in CSS allows you to position an element on the page, and tell elements how to be positioned in relation to other elements on the page.

			There are four types of positioning: static, relative, absolute, and fixed.<br/>
			<ul><li>Static positioning is the default of HTML elements in CSS and will always be positioned in the normal flow of the page.</li>

			<li>Fixed positioning removes the element from the normal flow of the page and "fixes" it on the screen. as you scroll up and down, the fixed element holds position. This allows fixed elements to overlap other elements on the page.</li>

			<li>Relative positioning moves the element in a direction relative to where it normally would be placed on the screen. This allows you to move the element while preserving the space normally used by that element on the page.</li>

			<li>Absolute positioning allows the user to define positioning based on either another positioned element or the default of html.</li></ul>

			<p>Examples: <br/>

			div.pos_fixed {
	position: fixed;
	top: 50px
	left: 30px;
}<br/>
This fixes the div 50 pixels from the top and 30 pixels from the left.<br/>

div.pos_relative {
	position: relative;
	right:40px;
}<br/>
This moves the element 40 pixels to the right, while preserving the space to the left of the elements where it normally would be located.<br/>

div.pos_abs {
	position: absolute;
	right:75px;
	top:150px;
}<br/>
This places the element 75 pixels from the right and 150 pixels from the top.</p></div>
