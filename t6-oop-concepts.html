		<div id="body">
			<p>Both inheritance and composition are ways of reusing logic in multiple places in your code. Each has their pros and cons, which we will explore below. Hopefully this will give you a basic understanding of when to use each and pique your interest to further explore their applications.</p>
			<p>Inheritance is a way of reusing code or establishing a sub-type from an existing object. For those who may be visual learns, the use of inheritance makes a specific visual choice in the organization of your code, saying that it is <em>a type of</em> whatever superclass you have stablished.</p>
			<pre>
		Class Automobiles
			attr_accessor :name :type
			initialize(name, type)
		end

		Class Trucks < Automobiles
			# more stuff about trucks here
		end

			</pre>	
			<p>In this code, we have a superclass called Automobiles that is initialized with two arguments. Below that, there is a class called trucks. Using the arrow, we can assign this class to the superclass Automobiles. This says that the trucks class, which may have specific methods and variables, at least shares the name and type arguments with the superclass.</p>

			<p>How can we use Composition in Ruby to reuse some of the code from a superclass?</p>
			<p>I have to admit that doing research into inheritance was much easier than figuring out composition.</p>
			<pre>
		Module Automobiles
			attr_accessor :name :type
			initialize(name, type)
		end
			
		Class Trucks
			include Automobiles
		end

			</pre>

			<p>In this code, instead of creating a class a subclass, we assign the superclass to a module and then establish a class called trucks that includes the variables created int he module.</p>
			<p>To me, the composition way of organizing code seems a bit more complicated than organizing the code by inheritance. I like the look of inheritance better and I think that it is easier to manage longer pieces of code through inheritance. At this point, the differences seem negligible, but I'm hoping to learn more about both concepts and how I can properly apply them in my code.</p>
