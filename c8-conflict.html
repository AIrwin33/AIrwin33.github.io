	<p>1. Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?</p>
	<p>One time I was working on a project in a group that I was leading. Together, the group established certain goals and expectations about when certain parts of the project were going to be completed. Unfortunately, certain parts of the project weren't completed on time and I got upset with the group and at myself for not staying on schedule.</p>
	<p>2. What was the source of the conflict?</p>
	<p>This is occasionally a source of conflict for me. I often hold others to the same standards that I hold myself to, especially when it come to doing things on a schedule, or showing up to meet people on time. I think this comes from my basic understanding of respecting other peoples time and work. Sometimes this comes up when friends or colleagues are late for meeting me somewhere.</p>
	<p>3. What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</p>
	<p>On the most basic level, I feel angry in these situations because I feel disrespected.</p>
	<p>4. What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</p>
	<p>Once I had analyzed my basic emotions, I was able to set them aside and refocus on the task at hand without letting my emotions get in the way and taking out my anger on the group. I helped the team regroup and set new priorities that were better defined so that everyone knew what they were responsible for and when the tasks were expected to be completed.</p>
	<p>5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything? What did you learn from this experience?</p>
	<p>This was a valuable experience for me in how to manage groups of people and manage my own expectations during that process. While I felt that the expectations were clearly laid out, they were not laid out clear enough for others, which led to other group members not complete tasks on time. Assigning roles to each individual group member, instead of setting more vague expectations for the entire group, will help minimize this in the future.</p>
