		<div id="body">
			<p>This was the first time I put my website out into the non-DBC universe, asking a few of my more design-oriented friends to critique it. They ended up having some good feedback, most of which I've integrated into the site as it is today. I'm hoping to get my hands on a working version of adobe creative suite to play around with the color of the background (maybe a lighter sepia?).</p>
			<p>Admittedly, I didn't "maintain" the site as much as I previously committed to earlier in Phase 0. I ended up writing the blog posts and just throwing them on the site and calling it a day. I was thinking that going forward I could do a quick scan of the site each time I add content to see what I can change or add on the front end.</p>
			<p>Looking over some of the other websites that my cohort created, I felt like mine was a bit sparse, but then I decided that I liked to keep it simple for now. Thats why they call it web development, right?</p>
			<p>I got a little carried away working with Adobe Kuler again, but I think I landed on a better palette. I wanted to stick with a prairie-style motif, and I looked through some pictures of <a href="http://goo.gl/NRszlI">Frank Lloyd Wright leaded-glass windows</a> for different colors.</p>
			<p>There are a few things I'd like to add if time allows during the full time part of DBC. I'm hoping to move the website into javascript and practice more of the jquery tools I learned this week. As I progress through the next three phases of DBC, I'll be adding to the portfolio section and adding my re-organized resume that is focused on dev jobs. When career week comes along, I'm also thinking of creating a more specific "personal profile" on the landing page.</p>
			<p>If you have any feedback on the site, give me a shout on my social media tabs on the front page!</p>
