			<p>Prompt: <em>Reflect on your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.</p>

			<p>Now, contemplate the idea of growth vs. fixed mindset. Part of knowing about your thinking styles is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we also want to encourage you to broaden the ways you learn and think. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think. The more well-rounded you are, the easier it will be to learn quickly and effectively.</em></p>

			<p>I looked back over the test I took before starting Phase 0 and found that my learning/thinking style is concrete sequential. Thinkers and learners with this Mind Style value order, predictability, and clarity. I've definitely been keenly aware of this since starting DBC. Working through certain exercises and challenges, I may struggle with directions that are not clear but thrive when I understand the directions and the specific logic of the code "makes sense." For example, I struggled for a while on a challenge last week because when I read the word "browser" I thought that meant web browser, not my terminal. When learning new concepts, I sometimes write the code in a way that makes sense to me, but not the computer. At that point I may hit a wall and struggle to think of a new way of thinking about the problem. Later, when I find a solution and I understand the logic behind the solution, I am able to remember it and carry out the correct code in the future. </p>

			<p>I also read that people with my learning style don't like unstructered environments and abstract ideas which can be common in Phase 0. I've tried to make my work during Phase 0 as structured as possible by maintaining a steady schedule to work on challenges.</p>

			<p>As for my mindset, having a growth mindset can be beneficial to working in a new industry. I think it generally helps people temper their egos and not get down on themselves when learning a new skill.</p>

			<p>Ultimately, I think that my learning style lends itself well to programming even if there may be certain limitations to it. Being aware of my learning style and mindset will help me practice the ways of counteracting the weaknesses of my learning style. Throughout Phase 0 I hope to maintain a fairly steady schedule and ask for clarification and help on certain projects that I don't understand. Remote learning has the downside of not being able to have the teacher right in front of you all the time. I think this can make it very easy to spend a lot of time banging your head against the wall trying to figure out a challenge instead of stepping back, asking for guidance and moving on. I think being able to work on the wireframing/site planning process will also be a great outlet for practicing abstract thinking, while ultimately committing it to a very concrete form.</p>
