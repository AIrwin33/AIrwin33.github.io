            <h4>What is Pair Programming?</h4>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Pair programming is a specific style of working on lines of code together. It is distinguished from two programmers working side-by-side of the same code. There is a specific communication style between two programmers that defines who will "Drive" and who will "Navigate". This makes the process more collaborative.</p>

            <h4>Why is Pair Programming important to DBC?</h4>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Whether you are the driver or the navigator, it is sometimes difficult to not just jump in and solve whatever challenge your pair is working on. For beginners honing their coding skills, it is a way for DBC students to better explain what they are working on. Also, it fits in with DBC's focus on engineering empathy. Working together in pairing sessions helps develop the soft skills that DBC teaches.</p>

            <h4>Compare Drivers and Navigators</h4>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Drivers are responsible for typing out the code as they are guided by the Navigator. They should ask any clarifying questions of the Navigator if they are confused. The Navigator is responsible for guiding what the Driver is coding on the screen and being as specific as possible in their directions.</p>

            <h4>Reflection on Pair Programming</h4> 
            </div>
        <div>
            <p>My first few pair programming sessions were sometimes awkward. I hadn't used videochats before coming to DBC and I think the first pair programming assignments were less conducive to pair work than some of the later ones. I did enjoy working on the Week 3 exercises in pairs because it was easier to divide up the tasks and switch off between Driving and Navigating.
