			<p>By now, everyone in the Squirrels cohort is well acquainted with the concept of peer pairing and both giving and receiving feedback. We've also had the opportunity to look at the feedback we've been given and take away some things to improve on.</p>
			<p>At first, pairing was a bit rough. I was not as comfortable as I am now with the whole process. I did however, start getting used to the google-hangouts format and now really enjoy the collaborative process. I think some challenges work better as pairing challenges, and others do not. The exercises in week 3 were probably best suited for pairing because pairs could switch off roles easier. I've found with certain challenges that can't be easily divided or there is not a logical break for when to switch roles.</p>

			<p>A couple weeks ago, I was working on a challenge with a pair and really struggled with how to set up loops. The feedback I received was specific and kind, suggesting that I take some time to really solidify my understanding of loops. I worked through a few of the earlier tutorials about loops and looked at a few different explanations to better understand the concept. I also arranged a tutoring session that allowed me to ask some more pointed questions.</p>

			<p>The practice of giving feedback is also something that has taken some practice. Ideally, giving feedback helps you focus more on details during the pairing session itself. In my first few pairing sessions, I wasn't sure what sort of constructive feedback to give. Now that I have paired with a good amount of the people in my cohort and that I have a better understanding of programming languages, I'm getting a sense of where people can improve.</p>
			
			<p>Overall, the pairing sessions have been enriching. When learning any new skill, its important to learn how to explain how to do something to another person in a way that they can understand it and repeat it. Being a navigator during pairing sessions has helped me tremendously in being able to organize my thoughts about the code I'm working on.</p>
