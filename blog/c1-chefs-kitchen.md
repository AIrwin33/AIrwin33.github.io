Reflection on DBC culture

What are my expectations going into the program

October 31, 2014

what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

I get the sense that the DBC experience is always evolving based on what works, what doesn't, and how the staff have seen the students learn best. The staff and teachers are earnestly invested in making sure students graduate and are the best reflection of the education they have been given. I get the impression already that DBC strives to create a team environment. From the beginning of Phase 0 we are encouraged to reach out to our cohort to give and receive help on projects. What could turn into a competitive environment very quickly is diminished by the pairing exercises. The emphasis on soft skills is for me what first set DBC apart from other coding bootcamps and something that I'm excited to work on. I think this is something anyone can improve on and is especially important when moving into a new field. Graduates could easily rely on the hard skills they learned at DBC to get them through the first few months on the job, instead of allowing their engineering empathy to be an asset to their new team on day one.

As someone who loves cooking with friends at home, I liked the restaurant/kitchen analogy. In these situations there is often a "Flow" that hits once everyone in the kitchen knows what they are doing and are contributing to the end goal. While I like getting to "Flow" on my own, I find it most rewarding when it happens in a team environment.

That being said, I think we are all taking a big jump getting into DBC. We are being asked to leave whatever level of comfort we had in our old situations (jobs, family, a normal sleep schedule, etc.) and learn something completely new in a matter of weeks. This makes me a bit nervous but grateful for the phase 0 prep that is getting us all ready. I'm looking forward to hitting the ground running in January!
