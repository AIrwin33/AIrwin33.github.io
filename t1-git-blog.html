			<p><em>What are the benefits of version control?</em></p>

			<p>Version control can be used when working alone or in groups as a way to manage multiple versions of a project. When coding, developers may hit bugs along the way to completing a project. Version control allows developers to go back to a previous version (one that does not have bugs) to move forward with clean code. When working in groups, version control is especially useful in managing the workflow of developers without having to run across the room (or across town) to deliver a flashdrive with the newest version of the project on it. Developers also have the ability to work on the same project without erasing someone elses work.</p>

			<p><em>How does Git help you keep track of changes?</em></p>

			<p>Git is a version control software that is local (on your computer). Through the terminal, developers can use Git to track the changes they have made before saving them (committing them) to a new version. On the terminal, there are three levels of changes as the developer moves from adding changes to committing them: untracked changes, tracked changes not staged to commit, and changes staged to commit. through the reset or checkout commands, developers can go back on certain steps in making changes.</p>

			<p><em>Why use GitHub to store your code?</em></p>

			<p>Github is a website widely used by developers to store their projects remotely while working on Git for version control. It is very useful for developers working on open source code or who are working in teams and need a central repository to upload the versions they are working on in Git. Many developers are already familiar with Github so being able to use it yourself to store code can make you more accessible to other developers when the opportunity to work in teams arises. Github also acts as a social network for developers. Maintaining a robust Github can help beginning developers network and interact with the vast developer community.</p>
