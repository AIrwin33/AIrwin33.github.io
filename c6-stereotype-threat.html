			<p>As humans, we live and work in social groups. We may form identities based on everything from nationality, ethnicity, class, gender, and other factors. These identities, based on each person, may be more or less pronounced. Unfortunately, many identities have negative stereotypes attached to them. When individuals internalize these negative steroetypes and begin doubting their ability to perform in certain situations, we call that steroetype threat.</p>
			<p>So who is affected by stereotype threat? While research into stereotype threat has mostly focused minority groups in academic situations, reasearch also found stereotype threat exists among women in math and science fields, white men in athletics and interracial interactions, and those with behavioral health issues in certain social situation.</p>
			<p>Some may identify more with a given group than others, making negative stereotypes more salient in situations they are in. The identities of those feeling stereotype threat may not be visible, such as socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, and behavioral health status.</p>
			<p>In both professional and academic situations, many types of stereotype threat can not just seed doubt, but actually impact performance. Especially when working in a team environment, it is to the benefit of everyone in the group to make sure the team is working on a task optimally. Stereotype threat may impact team performance at DBC and beyond, which is why it is important to look to way to reduce it.</p>
			<p>What can you and I do to reduce stereotype threat?</p>
			<p>I think the issue of stereotype threat fits in well with how we solve diversity issues in tech. However, reducing stereotype threat in the tech community requires more than just inclusive hiring practices. Reducing stereotype threat comes down to using different language that deemphasizes certain stereotypes and may reframe the task so that it does not highlight social identities. As a member of this community, I will practice avoiding certain language that highlights social identities and reframing task descriptions so that they do not trigger certain threats.</p>
