			<p>When I think about thes times in my life where I've felt the happiest and most satisfied, the values of meaningful work, helping society, and achievement come to mind the most. In general, I would strongly agree that I try to live up to these values every day.</p>
			<p>One of those values, meaningful work, is particularly important to me, and one of the reasons that I started at DBC. I found quickly that the career path I thought that I wanted did not feed my desire for meaningful work. I quickly realized that a more effective way to feed this desire would be to apply my knowledge of sustainability issues through the lense of software and web development. At the end of each day, I hope to look back at the code I've written and feel that I've made an impact and created value in peoples lives.</p>
			<p>The last time I gave someone advice it was to a friend who was in the process of setting up a junior board at t alocal non-profit organization. Having been through the same process, I gave him some advice on some of things I would do differently and what really worked. At the end of the discussion, I felt like my work and perspective was appreciated. Of the three values I discussed above, this also also helped me feel like I was living up to the value I place in achievement.</p>
			<p>I think generally, my values of acheivement and helping society can impact my personal stereotype threat. Since I place such high value on doing well and doing good, I sometimes get anxious about possibly falling short of that.

			Thoughout Phase 0, I've gotten stuck and felt down about not really "getting" what I was supposed to learn. However, I often realize that many people in my cohort are in the same boat and struggled through the same challenges that I've had issues with. The accountability groups have been very effective at this and I hope to practice reaching out to others throughout the on-site phases.</p>
